Stash Disapprove Plugin
====================

This plugin is designed to allow users to "disapprove" a pull request,
preventing it from being merged until the disapproval is toggled back off.
This provides a visual cue to the users that someone has explicitly requested
the pull request not be merged at this time.  The disapproval plugin can be
configured to require the "disapprover" to approve before the PR can be merged,
or it can be in "advisory mode" where the disapproval is not binding.

This plugin is similar in purpose (but written without consulting in any way)
the Block PullRequest plugin for Stash, which is a commercial and non-free
alternative.
